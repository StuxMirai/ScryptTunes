# ScryptTunes

Welcome to ScryptTunes! This application allows you to control your Spotify playlist through Twitch chat commands. This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process, step-by-step.

NOTE: This bot requires Spotify Premium. This is a Spotify API reqirement and there's nothing I can do about it

### Dev Announcements:
