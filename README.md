# ScryptTunes

Welcome to ScryptTunes! This application allows you to control your Spotify playlist through Twitch chat commands. This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process, step-by-step.

NOTE: This bot requires Spotify Premium. This is a Spotify API reqirement and there's nothing I can do about it

### Dev Announcements:
 - Channel points redeem is broken, working on a fix. I will disable it in the next release. Don't use it, just doesnt work at all!

## Table of Contents
1. [Install](#install)
2. [Setup](#setup)
3. [Usage](#usage)

 ## Install
1. Go to the latest release page here: [ScrypTunes Latest Release](https://github.com/StuxVT/ScryptTunes/releases/latest)
2. Download `ScryptTunesInstaller.exe` and run it
3. ScryptTunes will now show up in your start menu and as a desktop shortcut

## Setup
### 1. General
1. Open ScryptTunes and click the "Settings" button.
2. Fill in the following fields:
    - **Nickname**: Name of bot account.
      - If you don't use a separate twitch account for your bot, just put your channel name here.
    - **(Optional) Prefix**: Enter the command indicator for Twitch chat (e.g., `!`). 
    - **Channel**: Channel to listen for commands from. (Very likely to be your twitch channel name)
    - **Token**: Get your Twitch OAuth token from [Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
      - This is a safe resource that generates the token locally on the browser. Don't share it with anyone.
