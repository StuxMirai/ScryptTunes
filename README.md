#### Song request queue for stream. Customized version of [TwitchTunes](https://github.com/mmattDonk/TwitchTunes) with various bugfixes and extra features (Like support for youtube links). All credit goes to [mattDonk](https://github.com/mmattDonk) for the majority of the baseline bot.

#### Also please dont look at my UI code i wrote this at like 4am oh god its so bad

## todo
- GUI
- run as executable (terminal is hard for some)

## wish-list
(if i get time in the future)
- local browser source for queue visualization
- maybe implement the above into a twitch panel/plugin?
