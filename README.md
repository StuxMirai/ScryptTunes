#### Song request queue for stream. Customized version of [TwitchTunes](https://github.com/mmattDonk/TwitchTunes) with various bugfixes and extra features (Like support for youtube links). All credit goes to [mattDonk](https://github.com/mmattDonk) for the majority of the baseline bot.

#### Also please dont look at my UI code i wrote this at like 4am oh god its so bad

## todo
- run with OBS start? maybe set this up with installer
- run as executable (terminal is hard for some)
- define some form of interface for custom input frames to standardize retrieving/setting values and other common tasks

## wish-list
(if i get time in the future)
- local browser source for queue visualization
- maybe implement the above into a twitch panel/plugin?
